# Contributing

We really love contributions! Simply follow these three steps to contribute:

1. Sign one of the Contributor License Agreements below.
2. Fork the repo, develop, and test your changes.
3. Submit a pull request to the repo with your changes.

We will review your change and if it all looks good, your change will be merged.
If it appears your change needs additional work, we will let you know with
useful comments so you can adjust your pull request accordingly.

## Contributor License Agreements

Before creating a pull request, please fill out either the individual or
corporate Contributor License Agreement.

- **Individual:** If you are an individual writing original source code and
you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign the
[individual CLA][indv-cla].
- **Corporate:** If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute
your work to this client library, then you'll need to sign the
[corporate CLA][corp-cla].

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll add you
to the official list of contributors and be able to accept your changes.
